      This is me, Dustin Chapman!

    My name is Dustin Chapman. I just turned 35 years old and I am currently a Junior
    Software Engineer for H & R Block in Kansas City. I spend over 10 years working on
    diesel engines and electrical power generators and wanted to make a switch. I have
    been self-taught up to this point and really enjoy the field. I am married with three
    beautiful and crazy children. I have also been in the Kansas Air National Guard for
    almost 13 years and am currently deployed in Kuwait. By the way after three 
    deployments... I hate sand.

    Aside from spending time with family and working, I enjoy anything that relates to
    fitness and am a purple belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), which will be the topic of 
    my webpage. BJJ has brought so much to my life, my family, and has revealed things 
    about myself that otherwise may have never learned or appreciated. I plan to share 
    some of that with you.
