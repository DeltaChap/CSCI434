    			Hello everyone; a little about me. I just turned 35 years old 					   and I am currently a Junior Software Engineer for H & R Block in Kansas City. I
		spend over 10 years working on diesel engines and electrical power
		generators and wanted to make a switch. I have been self-taught up to
		this point and really enjoy the field. I am married with three beautiful
		and crazy children. I have also been in the Kansas Air National Guard
		for almost 13 years and am currently deployed in Kuwait. By the way,
		after three deployments... I hate sand. <br>

    	Aside from spending time with family and working, I enjoy anything that
		relates to fitness and am a purple belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ),
		which will be the topic of my webpage. BJJ has brought so much to my
		life, my family, and has revealed things about myself that otherwise may
		have never learned or appreciated. I plan to share some of that with
		you. <br>
